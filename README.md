# 4Dnest Android Client

4Dnest Android Client is a client application for privacy-enhanced social media system, 4Dnest (currently being worked on with name [Arki/MestaDB](https://github.com/sizzlelab/Arki/)).

## Problem

__Users of "traditional" social media cannot be sure who really is able to access their data.__

## Solution

__A secure (privacy-oriented) media sharing system where the user (group) has complete control of the data storage and access.__


4Dnest system differentiates itself from existing social media sites (e.g. Google+, Facebook, Twitter) by making the interactions truly private and giving control of the whole cycle to private individuals. Instead of sending data to public cloud servers maintained by a private company, user can set up his own private server and use that to communicate with whoever access is given to.

## Team

4Dnest Android Client is currently being worked on by a team of Aalto University students. Public project management documents and more technical stuff can be found from [our public Google Docs collection](https://docs.google.com/leaf?id=0By8t41m-ddd0NzUxZTUxNDQtZTZlOC00YTc5LTgyYzktZmE3NWI2YzJjY2Nm&hl=en_US)
